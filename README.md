markdown-format package
=======================

Markdown Format runs `markdownfmt` on save, which formats your Markdown text to look like the HTML.

You need to point to the path of the `markdownfmt` binary, which you can get at [github.com/shurcooL/markdownfmt](https://github.com/shurcooL/markdownfmt).
